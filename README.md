# Linter
We are using the rule set from https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard-with-typescript, with a few rules turned off that can be viewed in .eslintrc.json

To see errors, install the ESLint plugin on VSCode

To lint and run commands, run `npx eslint yourcommand`

Additionally, for convenience, set up your default formatter to be ESlint
